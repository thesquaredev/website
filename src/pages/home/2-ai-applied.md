We apply our AI research in numerous fields through the combination of data science and computer science.
Cancer diagnosis and classification, pandemics and linked open data are some of the fields we are working on to apply our findings.
Using neural networks, natural language processing and graphs at scale, we try to solve problems that the human brain is incapable of.
The core value of our systems is that they are accessible and understandable by everyone (explainable AI).
Our advances are always directed at improving our quality of life.

INCISIVE aims to address three major open challenges in order to explore the full potential of AI solutions in cancer imaging: AI challenges unique to medical imaging,
image labelling and annotation and data availability and sharing. In order to do that INCISIVE partners will develop an automated-ML based annotation mechanism to rapidly produce training data for machine learning research and and a pan-European federated repository of medical images, that will enable the secure donation of data in compliance with ethical, legal and privacy demands. This will increase accessibility to datasets and enabling experimentation of AI-based solutions.

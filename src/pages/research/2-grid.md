# This markdown file will render a "grid" component, which shows a grid containing a series οφ tiles. The following
# properties may be set (properties with * are required, to leave a property blank use ''):
#
# template*: The page template to use, leave it "default" if not sure
# component*: The React component to use (here is "grid")
# heading: The title of the section
# description: The subtitle of the section
##
template: default
component: grid
heading: Several different domains with a common denominator. Data.
# HOW TO USE TEXT BELOW:
#
# Each H1 header (rows starting with #) becomes the tile's title
# Each H2 header (rows starting with ##) becomes the tile's icon
# Each paragraph (rows with just text) becomes the tile's main text

# Explainable AI

## user-360-bold-green.png

AI decisions have remained a black-box for a long time. We try to solve this by building **expandability** in systems. All our AI systems use expandability at their core. One of our research projects [INCISIVE](/research#imagetext4) is focused on classifying cancer images and explaining the patterns found to the user for better understanding. Credit reports produced in [Wysely](/research#imagetext3) provide a holistic assessment explained to risk officers.

# Neural Networks

## brain-bold-green.png

We use **neural networks** for out AI powered systems. Some of the fields we are currently using this technology is cancer image classification [INCISIVE](/research#imagetext4) and transaction classification in [Wysely](/research#imagetext3) from open banking data. Neural network architectures capitalise on the volume of data and provide stellar results.

# Natural Language Classification

## robot-head-bold-green.png

We use our **natural language classification engine** in [Wysely](/research#imagetext3) for transaction classification. This results in contextually understanding data and providing accurate, actionable insights that are explainable to the end-user.

# Graphs at Scale & Linked Data

## databases-bold-green.png

At [STAMINA](/research#imagetext5), one of out research projects, we scout the web and and semantically link open data with our **natural language classification engine** creating a large graph. Then **graph data science** techniques are used on the data to provide insights and alerts.

We are building agents that: extracts key phrases, places, people, brands, or events, understand how positive or negative the text is, analyze text using tokenization and parts of speech, and automatically organizes a collection of text by topic or class. We combine this with other deep learning principles and produce new data and insights that are previously hard to measure.
